** Create a dababase name practice and create collection name order**
** Inside order create multiple documents with key value pair yourself **
For example of one such document: (make sure multiple cust_id has same value (for grouping purpose))
{
cust_id: "ID1",
"ord_date": ISODate("2018-05-04"),
"price": 400,
"status": "A",
"item qty": 20
}

{
cust_id: "ID1",
"ord_date": ISODate("2020-05-04"),
"price": 400,
"status": "not A",
"item qty": 20
}

{
cust_id: "ID2",
"ord_date": ISODate("2015-05-04"),
"price": 200,
"status": "not A",
"item qty": 10
}
# Insert multiple such record

1. For each unique cust_id, sum the price field on your created order collection

2. For each unique cust_id, sum the price field, results sorted by sum in order collection

3. For each unique cust_id, ord_date grouping, sum the price field. Excludes the time portion of the date.

4. For cust_id with multiple records, return the cust_id and the corresponding record count.

5. For each unique cust_id, ord_date grouping, sum the price field and return only where the sum is greater than 250. Excludes the time portion of the date.

6. For each unique cust_id with status A, sum the price field

7. For each unique cust_id with status A, sum the price field and return only where the sum is greater than 250.

8. For each unique cust_id, sum the corresponding line item qty fields associated with the orders.

9. Count the number of distinct cust_id, ord_date groupings. Excludes the time portion of the date.
