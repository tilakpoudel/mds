Guys, atleast give yourself 20 min hai, it should be installed. Does not takes much time. If any error comes regrading Hadoop, we will talk tomorrow.


1. hadoop fs -mkdir /democlass   # to create directory in hadoop with name democlass
 
Create file name as input.txt into Desktop and copy its location (e.g. C:/users/Desktop/input.txt)
 
2. hadoop fs -put C:/users/Desktop/input.txt  /democlass  #copying input.txt to democlass hdfs directory
 
# Run map reduce example: location is : (example: C:\Users\Public\hadoopsetup\hadoop-3.2.4\share\hadoop\mapreduce\hadoop-mapreduce-examples-3.2.4.jar) 
Remember jar file is executable: make sure it is jar file
 
3. hadoop jar C:\Users\Public\hadoopsetup\hadoop-3.2.4\share\hadoop\mapreduce\hadoop-mapreduce-examples-3.2.4.jar  wordcount  /democlass/input.txt  /output
 
Here wordcount is class name for word count program 
/democlass/input.txt is input file
/output is output location
 
4. NOTE: if error: something like previlege error then run command prompt in administrator mode and run step 3
 
5. After map reduce sucess: check output
 
6. hadoop fs -ls /output
 
7. hadoop fs - cat /output/part-r-00000
 
### classwork #### 
search hadoop streaming in python in google and implement hadoop streaming (https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/hadoop-streaming-using-python-word-count-problem/)
 
Hadoop streaming location: C:\Users\Public\hadoopsetup\hadoop-3.2.4\share\hadoop\tools\lib\hadoop-streaming-3.2.4.jar
 
Create input.txt in desktop and put some text into it
 
8. hadoop jar C:\Users\Public\hadoopsetup\hadoop-3.2.4\share\hadoop\tools\lib\hadoop-streaming-3.2.4.jar
                 -input C:/users/desktop/input.txt 
                -output /output  
                -mapper C:/users/Desktop/mapper.py
                -reducer C:/users/Desktop/reducer.py
 
 
Mapper.py and reducer.py is in the website. Check the website properly. Make sure mapper.py and reducer.py has correct print statement... 
print statement is incorrect for python3.+
